<h2> Periodic table </h2>

<p>
In this project I replicated the whole periodic table in the android system. The arrangement of elements was the
              dificult part in the process but I was able to complete that. After that to add more functionality, I provided facility to click on each element 
              of the table to get detailed information about it. It included information such as the group to which it belongs, atomic weight etc. I also 
          	  provided facility to hear the pronunciation of the name of the element
